title=Visible Planets Scale

[mod-description]
description=Adds automatic scaling to planets rendered by Visual Planets based on their gravity

[mod-setting-name]
vp-scale-min=Minimum planet scale
vp-scale-max=Maximum planet scale
vp-scale-enable-rotation-multiplier=Day/Night Cyle rotation speed adjustment
vp-scale-min-moon=Minimum moon scale (PlanetsLib)
vp-scale-max-moon=Maximum moon scale (PlanetsLib)

[mod-setting-description]
vp-scale-min=The minimum scale multiplier relative to Nauvis for a planet with very little gravity.
vp-scale-max=The maximum scale multiplier relative to Nauvis for a planet with very high gravity.
vp-scale-enable-rotation-multiplier=Enable rotation speed adjustment based on the planet's day/night cycle duration relative to Nauvis' day/night cycle. Shorter day/night cycles result in faster rotation speeds, longer cycles result in slower rotation speeds.
vp-scale-min-moon=Minimum scale of the orbiting planets/moons introduced by PlanetsLib. This mods scaling factor is multiplied by Visible Planets' "Background bodies scaling" setting.
vp-scale-max-moon=Maximum scale of the orbiting planets/moons introduced by PlanetsLib. This mods scaling factor is multiplied by Visible Planets' "Background bodies scaling" setting.
